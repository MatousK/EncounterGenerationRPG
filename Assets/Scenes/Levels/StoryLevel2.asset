  IntroTexts:
  - "The messages grew in number. Before them stood three large signs, and on each
    a single word was written in blood.\nTogether they said \u201CYOU! WILL! DIE!\u201D\r\n\n\u201CHuh,
    someone is trying to get our attention\u201D, said Tom while poking one of the
    signs with his sword. \u201CIt almost looks\nlike someone is trying to tell us
    something. And look here, another one!\u201D\r\n\nThis sign was even larger, put
    together from hastily gathered boards and hanged on the wall where a torch used
    to be. It said \u201CAttention! It took me ages to get here, I had to best many
    a challenge to warn you, so just turn aro\u2026\u201D\nAnd the rest of the text
    was missing. Maybe bloodstains and toothmarks on the sign were to blame for that.\n\nBut
    Tom did not seem to care much. He just laughed and urged the group to venture
    forth. Apparently, regardless of these warnings, the future didn\u2019t scare
    him at all.\r"
