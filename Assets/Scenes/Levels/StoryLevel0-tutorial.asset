  IntroTexts:
  - "Once upon a time, Tom the Knight was in his final year of Adventurer College.
    \r\n\r\nHe successfully completed all the courses at the school - he breezed through
    all\r\ncombat classes and he even managed to get through the dreaded Chivalry
    class.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was for him now was to write a thesis about some
    interesting adventure.\r\nHe decided to explore the mysterious dungeon of Apdien,
    a magical place that was always\r\nfull of monsters exactly strong enough to challenge
    the visitors. This place was a favorite\r\ntraining exercise for the students,
    yet its purpose and workings were still as mysterious\r\ntoday as they were a
    thousand years ago.\n\nTom teamed up with two of his friends, Bob\r the Ranger
    and John the Cleric. Together they\nwould brave the dungeon, fill out surveys\r
    about their experience and hopefully they would\nget enough data to unlock the
    secrets of the dungeon.\r\n\r\nSo they checked their equipment one last time and
    entered the dungeon, ready for whatever\nthey would find down there..."
