  IntroTexts:
  - "Once upon a time, in the College for Overprivileged Adventurers, Tom the Knight
    stood in front of his brave comrades,\nJohn the Cleric and Bob the Ranger, in
    a suitably heroic pose.\r\n\n\u201COur last year of college!\u201D, he shouted,
    as Bob\u2019s hearing was not that great anymore.\n\u201CWe\u2019ve bested all
    the challenges here at the school, we've survived the cafeteria food and we are
    even quite close to\nfinally paying off our debt for that dog. You remember the
    dog, right John?\"\n\n\"Only one thing is missing\u201D, he continued.\n\u201CWe
    forgot to write a thesis about any of our adventures! And since we have to write
    one, I decided that we\u2019ll explore \nthe ancient dungeon of Apdien. Ever
    since  the investors lost interest in it, it got filled by all kinds of squatters.\nOrcs,
    the undead, goblins... In short, troublemakers. I say we are strong enough to
    defeat such opponents. And with\na bit of luck, we\u2019ll even discover the
    secrets that Apdien holds at its end. So, let\u2019s check our equipment one
    more time\nand find out what evil lurks inside the dungeon!\u201D\r\n\n\u201CWhy
    do all of your speeches have to drag out for this long?\u201D, John murmured.\r\n\u201CWhat
    did he say?\u201D, Bob asked.\r\n\nTom let out a deep sigh, turned around and
    took a first step towards their new adventure. \n\u201CAnd if I am at least a
    little bit lucky, both of these idiots could get killed down there\u201D, Tom
    thought on his way out."
