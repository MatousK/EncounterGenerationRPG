  IntroTexts:
  - "Once upon a time, in the College for Overprivileged Adventurers, Tom the Knight
    stood in front of his thesis opponent.\nHe stood there for quite a while, nervously
    watching the professor while he calmly examined his thesis.\r\n\n\u201CSo what
    do you think?\u201D He could not handle it anymore. \u201CI didn\u2019t sleep
    for several days you know. Two of my best\nfriends died down there. And what\u2019s
    worse, now I\u2019ll never pay off that stupid dog.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CJust wait,\u201D
    replied the opponent. \u201CI\u2019ll just draw on this scroll here a bit more,
    so you feel like I care about what you\u2019re\nsaying. After that I\u2019ll just
    give you my default answer.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D, asked Tom, quite confused.\r\n\n\u201CAnd
    now I\u2019m finished. Well, to me it looks like your comrades did all the work.
    According to the testimonies of some\ngoblins, you just went along for a ride,
    smashing signs along the way. I am sorry, but it would be quite unfair to your\nclassmates
    if we ignored our students slacking off like this. So we cannot accept this thesis
    as your own work. There is\nnothing more to be said. Fare well and better luck
    next time.\u201C\r\n\n\u201CGod damn it,\u201D cursed the battered and exhausted
    knight as he went to the doors. \u201CI should have just written about a\nquest
    for beers in the local tavern. That would have been much more believable\u201D.\r\n\nAnd
    thus ends the Knight\u2019s tale.\r"
