  IntroTexts:
  - "\u201CSeriously?!\u201D, Tom exclaimed when he noticed Bob\u2019s graffiti. \u201CHow
    did we get back to the first floor? The map is quite\nclear \u2013 go down the
    stairs! How could we get lost?\u201D\r\n\u201CWell, there must be some secret
    passage. Moving wall or something.\u201D Bob immediately set out to search the
    walls, but\nJohn stopped him with a glee on his face. \u201CWe do not need to
    search for hidden doors like some cavemen. We are\nmodern adventurers! We can
    use magic!\u201D\r\n\nHis comrades looked at him warily. \u201CYou\u2019ve taken
    care of the side effects, right? I don\u2019t want to end up like that dog.\u201D\r\nJohn
    dismissed their worries with a wave of his hand and raised his staff above his
    head. \u201CWorry not! A minor\nteleportation spell for only 9.99 and as a free
    gift we\u2019ll get a very practical gift \u2013 a brand new whetstone for our
    knight!\nAnd if we cast another spell within 5 minutes, we will also get a set
    of real crystal glasses, perfect for drinking the blood\nof our enemies!\u201D\r\n\nThey
    stood there sillently, as Bob and Tom were considering the pros and cons of relying
    on John's magic once again.\nBob was the first one to speak: \u201CGods above,
    just cast the spell already! I want those glasses!\u201D And John obliged.\n\nA
    loud boom echoed through the halls, something cracked in the darkness and suddenly,
    the group appeared at \na completely different spot.\r\n\n\u201CDamn you!\u201D,
    exclaimed Tom. What did your spell do? I feel like a damn freshman again!\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat,
    are you that nervous?\u201D\r\n\u201COf course not! I feel as weak as a kitten!
    You sucked out all of our power ups you hack!\u201D\r"
