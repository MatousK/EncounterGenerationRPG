  IntroTexts:
  - "As they were walking down the stairs, the group started losing all its focus.
    \u201CWhat did John say?\u201D, Bob asked, while\ncarving graffiti on the dungeon
    walls with his arrows.\r\n\n\u201CThat you suck at spelling. What does this even
    mean? We\u2019ll dance on your greaves? Scratch that, you should stop\nplaying
    around and pay more attention. This is only the first floor, we need to focus
    on the thesis.\u201D\r\n\nAs they pressed on, their torches illuminated the walls,
    revealing artwork left by other dungeon delvers whose spelling\nwas, amazingly
    enough, even worse than Bob\u2019s. The dungeon was enormous, much larger that
    it looked on the\noutside. But, despite all the dangers, all the walls were filled
    with graffiti and strange messages.\r\n\nTake for example the message just at
    the end of the staircase. It said \u201CNot one more step without protection!\u201D
    The\ngroup wondered why anyone would write that. Any certified adventurer would
    know that going anywhere without\nchastity belts was pure foolishness.\r"
