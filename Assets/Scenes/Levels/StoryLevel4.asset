  IntroTexts:
  - "After fighting their way through seemingly infinite hordes of enemies, the party
    finally reached the last floor. \r\n\u201CAt least now we know why the dean ordered
    a wall to be built around this place\u201D, said Tom, now visibly exhausted\nfrom
    all the fighting.\r\n\n\u201CBecause of the Mexicans?\u201D, asked Bob while playing
    with the glasses. \u201CYou know, when I look at them closely, I really\ndoubt
    these glasses are actually made from crystal.\u201D\r\n\nTom: \u201CWill you shut
    up already? This was a really dumb idea, trying to impress the thesis opponent
    with this\nadventure. We did not have to go for such a dangerous journey, and
    with our luck, no one will believe us about it \nanyhow.\u201D\r\n\n\u201CNah,
    you are overthinking this.\", said John. \"A little healing spell should make
    all your worries disappear just like that!\u201D\r\n\u201CNo!\u201D, exclaimed
    Tom and Bob simultaneously.\r\nJohn: \u201CYou guys are chickens. I just installed
    some new malware into my staff, there is nothing to fear anymore.\u201D\r\nTom:
    \u201CWell, except for what is waiting for us behind these doors.\u201D\r\nBob:
    \u201CWhat did you say?\u201D\r\nTom: \u201CI SAD EXCEPT FOR WHAT\u2026 Ah, screw
    it. I wanna go home\u201D\r\nJohn: \u201CCheer up, we\u2019ll make it! Be a brave
    sir knight. Maybe there us a surprise waiting for us?\u201D\r"
