  m_Text: "Once upon a time, Tom the Knight was in his final year of Adventurer College.
    \r\n\r\nHe successfully completed all the courses at the school - he breezed through
    all\r\ncombat classes and he even managed to get through the dreaded Chivalry
    class.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was for him now was to write a thesis about something
    adventuring related.\r\nHe decided to visit the mysterious dungeon of Apdien,
    a magical place that was always\r\nfull of monsters exactly strong enough to challenge
    the visitors. This place was a favorite\r\ntraining exercise for the students,
    yet its purpose and workings were still as mysterious\r\ntoday as they were a
    thousand years ago. Tom teamed up with two of his friends, Bob\r\nthe Ranger and
    John the Cleric. Together they would brave the dungeon, fill out surveys\r\nabout
    their experience and hopefully they would get enough data to unlock the secrets
    of \nthe dungeon.\r\n\r\nSo they set out on their journey. Being the proper researchers,
    they first filled out a survey\r\nabout their current state of mind.\r..\n"
