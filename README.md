# Thesis Quest
This game was created as a master's thesis project at the Charles University. The main goal of this thesis was to create a new algorithm for generating combat encounters in RPG games. This algorithm was implemented in a short game you can see in this repository and distributed to the general public that played the game.

# Requirements
This game was developed using the Unity engine version 2019.2.12. The game is not guaranteed to work on any version other than this one.

# Additional packages
We could not distribute all the assets used in this game. To run the game, you must add the TextMesh Pro by selecting Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Essential Resources. You can also install the following packages from the asset store. They are not required to run the game, but if you do not add them, the game will be silent.

Action RPG Music Free:  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/action-rpg-music-free-85434

Medieval Combat Sounds: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/weapons/medieval-combat-sounds-149395

Magic Spells Sound Effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/magic-spells-sound-effects-114628

LITE - Fantasy - Headstrong Archer Character Voice Sound Pack: https://bobfeeservo.itch.io/lite-fantasy-headstrong-archer-character-voice-sound-pack
This pack is not from the Asset Store. It provides the ranger voice and is more difficult to install. In Assets\Sounds\Voices\Ranger you will find .meta files corresponding to the audio files. You will have to find the corresponding .wav files in the voice pack and copy them next to the .meta files.

# Documentation
I feel that thorough documentation of the algorithm would be reduntant. Once my thesis is available online, I will add a link to it.
